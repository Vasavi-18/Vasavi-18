<h2 align="center">✨ Hey, I'm Vasavi ✨</h2>

<p align="center">
A curious mind walking the line between <strong>logic</strong> and <strong>lyricism</strong> —  
building systems, writing stories, and shaping ideas with equal passion.  
Here, I turn my learning into code and my thoughts into possibility.

## 🎨 A Little Poetic Side

  “I write code the way I write poems —  
  with intention, rhythm, and a quiet belief  
  that every line can lead somewhere meaningful.”
